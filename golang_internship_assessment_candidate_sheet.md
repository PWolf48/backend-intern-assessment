# SECTION 1: Single-Choice Multiple Choice
*Instructions: Choose the single best answer for each question (A, B, C, or D).*  
*👉 Commit & push after completing this section.*

### Part A: Git & Version Control

**1. You modified multiple files, but only want to stage and commit one specific file (`auth.go`). Which command sequence is correct?**
- A) `git commit -a -m "add auth"`
- B) `git add auth.go` followed by `git commit -m "feat: implement auth logic"`
- C) `git push origin auth.go` followed by `git commit`
- D) `git checkout -b auth.go` followed by `git commit`

**Answer**
- B) `git add auth.go` followed by `git commit -m "feat: implement auth logic"`


**2. What is the key operational difference between `git merge` and `git rebase` when integrating changes from `main` into your feature branch?**
- A) `git merge` deletes the feature branch history, while `git rebase` preserves it.
- B) `git merge` creates a new merge commit preserving exact chronological branch history; `git rebase` rewrites commit history onto the tip of `main` for a linear history.
- C) `git rebase` can only be performed on the remote repository.
- D) `git merge` is only used for pulling remote changes; `git rebase` is used only for stashing.

**Answer**
- B) `git merge` creates a new merge commit preserving exact chronological branch history; `git rebase` rewrites commit history onto the tip of `main` for a linear history.

**3. You committed code with the message `"fix typo"`, but you forgot to include a modified configuration file (`config.yaml`). If the commit has NOT been pushed to remote yet, what is the cleanest way to include the file into the previous commit?**
- A) Run `git reset --hard HEAD~1` and start over.
- B) Stage the config file (`git add config.yaml`) and run `git commit --amend --no-edit`.
- C) Delete the `.git` folder and reinitialize.
- D) Create a new branch and push both commits separately.

**Answer**
- B) Stage the config file (`git add config.yaml`) and run `git commit --amend --no-edit`.

**4. What happens when a Git merge conflict occurs?**
- A) Git automatically deletes conflicting files and retains remote files.
- B) Git rolls back the repository to the initial commit.
- C) Git marks the conflicting sections in the affected files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers, pausing the merge until resolved and committed.
- D) Git prevents any further commits until the remote repository is restarted.

**Answer**
- C) Git marks the conflicting sections in the affected files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers, pausing the merge until resolved and committed.

### Part B: Golang Fundamentals

**5. Consider the following Go code snippet:**
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func modifySlice(s []int) {
    s[0] = 99
    s = append(s, 100)
}

func main() {
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3}
    modifySlice(nums)
    fmt.Println(nums)
}
```
**What will be printed to the console?**
- A) `[99 2 3 100]`
- B) `[1 2 3]`
- C) `[99 2 3]`
- D) `[99 100 3]`

**Answer**
- C) `[99 2 3]`

**6. In Go, what is the default zero value of a pointer, a slice, a map, and an interface?**
- A) `0`
- B) `nil`
- C) `undefined`
- D) Empty struct `{}`

**Answer**
- B) `nil`

**7. How are errors typically handled in idiomatic Go?**
- A) By wrapping code in `try...catch...finally` blocks.
- B) By returning `(result, error)` as multiple return values and checking `if err != nil`.
- C) By using `panic()` and `recover()` for standard validation errors.
- D) By checking global runtime error variables.

**Answer**
- B) By returning `(result, error)` as multiple return values and checking `if err != nil`.

**8. What is the behavior of the `defer` statement in the following code?**
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func count() {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        defer fmt.Print(i, " ")
    }
}

func main() {
    count()
}
```
- A) `1 2 3 `
- B) `3 2 1 `
- C) `3 3 3 `
- D) `1 1 1 `

**Answer**
- B) `3 2 1 `

**9. Why is passing a large struct by pointer (`*User`) instead of by value (`User`) often preferred for functions that modify the user data?**
- A) Because Go does not support methods on struct values.
- B) Because passing by pointer avoids copying the entire struct in memory and allows the function to mutate the original struct's fields directly.
- C) Because value types cannot be stored in databases.
- D) Because Go's compiler will throw a syntax error if pointers are not used.

**Answer**
- B) Because passing by pointer avoids copying the entire struct in memory and allows the function to mutate the original struct's fields directly.

**10. In Go, how do you safely check whether a specific key exists in a map `userMap := map[string]int{"andi": 10}`?**
- A) `if userMap.contains("andi") { ... }`
- B) `if val, exists := userMap["andi"]; exists { ... }`
- C) `if userMap.hasKey("andi") { ... }`
- D) `if userMap["andi"] != undefined { ... }`

**Answer**
- B) `if val, exists := userMap["andi"]; exists { ... }`

### Part C: MySQL & MongoDB Databases

**11. In MySQL (InnoDB), what is the difference between a `PRIMARY KEY` and a `UNIQUE` key?**
- A) A table can have multiple `PRIMARY KEY`s, but only one `UNIQUE` key.
- B) A `PRIMARY KEY` cannot contain `NULL` values and creates a clustered index; a `UNIQUE` key enforces uniqueness but may permit `NULL` values.
- C) `UNIQUE` keys are only supported in NoSQL databases.
- D) `PRIMARY KEY` only works on integer data types.

**Answer**
- B) A `PRIMARY KEY` cannot contain `NULL` values and creates a clustered index; a `UNIQUE` key enforces uniqueness but may permit `NULL` values.

**12. Which SQL statement retrieves all users who registered in 2026, ordering the newest registrations first, limiting the results to 10 rows?**
- A) `SELECT * FROM users WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2026 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;`
- B) `SELECT * FROM users HAVING created_at = 2026 SORT BY created_at TOP 10;`
- C) `GET ALL FROM users FILTER BY 2026 ORDER DESCENDING LIMIT 10;`
- D) `SELECT TOP 10 * FROM users WHERE created_at IN (2026) GROUP BY created_at;`

**Answer**
- A) `SELECT * FROM users WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2026 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;`

**13. What is the fundamental difference between an `INNER JOIN` and a `LEFT JOIN` in SQL?**
- A) `INNER JOIN` returns only rows with matching keys in both tables; `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table (with `NULL` for non-matches).
- B) `INNER JOIN` is for MongoDB, while `LEFT JOIN` is for MySQL.
- C) `LEFT JOIN` deletes rows without foreign key references.
- D) `INNER JOIN` is always executed in memory, while `LEFT JOIN` is executed on disk.

**Answer**
- A) `INNER JOIN` returns only rows with matching keys in both tables; `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table (with `NULL` for non-matches).

**14. What is the purpose of database transactions and the "ACID" property?**
- A) To compress SQL query responses to reduce network latency.
- B) To ensure operations are Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability guaranteed, preventing partial updates during failures.
- C) To allow multiple users to bypass password authentication.
- D) To automatically convert SQL tables into MongoDB collections.

# SECTION 3: Short Essay Questions
*👉 Commit & push after completing this section.*

### Question 3.1: Go Struct Tags & JSON Security
**Scenario:**  
You are building a REST API in Go. You have a `User` struct that you want to return to frontend clients via JSON:
```go
type User struct {
    ID           int
    FullName     string
    Email        string
    PasswordHash string
}
```
However, two requirements must be fulfilled:
1. Frontend requires JSON keys in lowercase snake_case (e.g., `"full_name"` and `"email"`).
2. The `PasswordHash` field is sensitive security data and must **never** be included in the JSON output sent to the client.

- **Task:**
  1. Rewrite the `User` struct using Go struct tags (`json:"..."`) to satisfy both requirements.
  2. Explain what the `json:"-"` struct tag does during JSON serialization (`json.Marshal`).

### Question 3.2: Database Selection (MySQL vs. MongoDB)
**Scenario:**  
Your team is building an **E-Commerce Platform**. You need to store two main modules:
1. **User Wallets & Financial Balances:** Requires atomic transfers, zero data loss, strict consistency, and transaction rollbacks on failure.
2. **Product Catalog & Dynamic Specifications:** Products vary widely in attributes (e.g., Laptops have CPU/RAM, T-Shirts have Size/Color/Fabric, Shoes have Shoe Sizes).

- **Task:**
  - Which database (MySQL or MongoDB) would you choose for **User Wallets**, and which for **Product Catalog**?
  - Briefly justify your choices based on schema flexibility and ACID transaction guarantees.

# SECTION 4: Story Problem - Program Design & Coding
*👉 Implement your code, then make your final commit & push.*

### Scenario: "FlashSale Voucher Discount Engine"
You are tasked with building a core discount calculation component for an Indonesian e-commerce platform in **Golang**.

#### Requirements:
1. Define a Go `struct` named `CartItem` with fields:
   - `ProductID` (`string`)
   - `Name` (`string`)
   - `Price` (`float64`)
   - `Quantity` (`int`)
2. Define a Go `struct` named `Voucher` with fields:
   - `Code` (`string`)
   - `DiscountPercent` (`float64`, e.g., `10.0` for 10%)
   - `MaxDiscount` (`float64`, e.g., `50000.0` maximum discount cap)
   - `MinPurchase` (`float64`, minimum total cart amount required)
3. Implement a function with the following signature:
   ```go
   func CalculateFinalPrice(items []CartItem, voucher *Voucher) (subtotal float64, discount float64, total float64, err error)
   ```
4. **Business Validation Rules:**
   - If `items` slice is empty, return an error: `"cart cannot be empty"`.
   - If any item has `Quantity <= 0` or `Price < 0`, return an error: `"invalid item price or quantity"`.
   - Calculate `subtotal` as the sum of `Price * float64(Quantity)` for all items.
   - If `voucher` is `nil`, discount is `0`, and `total = subtotal`.
   - If `voucher` is provided:
     - Check if `subtotal >= voucher.MinPurchase`. If not, no discount is applied (`discount = 0`), but return **no error** (customer pays normal subtotal).
     - If eligible, calculate nominal discount = `subtotal * (voucher.DiscountPercent / 100)`.
     - If nominal discount exceeds `voucher.MaxDiscount`, cap the discount at `voucher.MaxDiscount`.
     - Final `total = subtotal - discount`.

- **Task:**
  Write the complete, runnable Go code implementing the structs, the `CalculateFinalPrice` function, and a simple `main()` test case.

*Write your Go code here:*
```go
package main

// TODO: Write your code here
```
